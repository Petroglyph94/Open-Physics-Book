# Distance between two points or coordinates

If you have 2 points

* Point 1 = $$(x_1, y_1, z_1)$$ 
* Point 2 = $$(x_2, y_2, z_2)$$ 

The **distance** or the **norm** between the two points is given by:

$$distance = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2} $$ 

### Why is that?

You're curious! Awesome!😁 

Let's go back to the 2D plane, we have a point
