# Why classical mechanics?

Virtually every physics course taught at each university or school starts by introducing classical mechanics. It serves as an important baseline to understanding more complicated topics, but still is extremely important to a vast array of applications in physics, engineering, biology and many other fields to this day. 

To physics education specifically, it is maybe the general topic with the smoothest transition from an intuitive understanding of the behaviour of physical objects to their mathematical description and more surprising implications of these descriptions. On the other hand, classical mechanics encompasses an extremely vast array of topics, several of which have spawned their own complete subfields.
